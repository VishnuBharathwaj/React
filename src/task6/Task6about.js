      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong enthusiasm
        for creating web applications and solving complex problems. With several
        years of experience in the field, I have had the opportunity to work on
        a wide range of projects, from building responsive websites to
        developing full-stack web applications. My technical skills, combined
        with my ability to think creatively and work collaboratively, allow me
        to craft effective and user-friendly digital solutions. Outside of
        coding, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new technologies.
